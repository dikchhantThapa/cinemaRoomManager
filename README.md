# Cinema Room Manager 

A cinema ticket booking system program.                                       

## Objectives                         
The objective of this program is to first read two positive integer numbers that represent the number of rows and seats in each row of a cinema. Then, it prints a menu with the following three items:                                     
**Show the seats** - print the current seating arrangement. The empty seats are be marked with an **S** symbol, and taken seats are marked with a **B** symbol.                                              
**Buy a ticket** - read the seat coordinates from the input and print the ticket price like in the previous stage. After that, the chosen seat is marked with a **B** when the item Show the seats is called.
**Exit** - stop the program
